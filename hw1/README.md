How To Run Code
1.	Open the zip file by either:
    a.	Double clicking the zipped file
        i.	Change directoriesâ€¦ cd hyatt-hw1
    b.	unzip hyatt-hw1.zip
2.	python3 titanic.py

**notes
1.	The code will not run properly if existing files inside the directory conflict with filenames of the datasets. For this reason I think that double clicking the zip file works best because it ensures that the datasets and python file are in their own directory.
2.	If not installed already, please install dependencies (sklearn, numpy, matplotlib). If it is a requirement in the future I will write a requirements.txt file, but I have never learned how to install dependencies through code.
